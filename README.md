## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-fpl.git
    cd custom-fpl
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```sh
    poetry shell
    ```

## Usage

### Data Scraping

To scrape data from FBref, run the following script:
```sh
get-data
```

### Data Preprocessing

To preprocess the scraped data, use the [`pre_process.py`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22pitchProphet%2Fdata%2Fpre_processing%2Fpre_process.py%22%5D "pitchProphet/data/pre_processing/pre_process.py") script:
```sh
pre-process
```

### Model Training

To train the predictive model, run the following script:
```sh
python pitchProphet/models/train_model.py
```

### Web Application

To start the web application, run:
```sh
python web/app.py
```
Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.


## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:
```sh
pytest
```
Test files are located in the [`tests/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22tests%2F%22%5D "tests/") directory.
